# CS-6120-23-Task-4

The code includes basic block extraction, control flow graph computation, and a data flow implementation for reaching definitions.
The intended pipeline is: `bril2json < {your_code.bril} | python my_dataflow.py`.
I have tested my implementation manually, using the Bril codes included in this repo.
